    <h1>Spotify API Test</h1>
    <h2>Testing recommendation</h2>
    <p>Authentication is tricky since it requires a <code>redirect</code>.  The webpage needs to be "whitelisted" on spotify developer account.  Live Server seems to work for me.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Click the button to authenticate; it will return to this page afterward with an <code>access_token</code> that is used in subsequent API calls.</p>
    <button id="spotifyLogin">Login to Spotify</button>
    <h3>Atrist Search</h3>
    <p>Atrist search JSON data is logged to the console.</p>
    <p>This is an artist search example specific to 'Ariana Grande'.  The actual search would be based on the artist selected from the TM list of all (filtered) artists.</p>
    <p>Below is data selected from the JSON data returned from the atrist search end point <code>https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=Ariana+Grande&type=artist</code></p>
    <div id="artistInfo"></div>
    <p>Click on the artist image to get an idea of some links can open directly into a Spotify web player.</p>

    <h3>Playlist</h3>
    <div id="artistPlaylists"></div>
    <p>Once you click the 'Get Playlist' button, you can view the JSON object in the console.</p>

    <h3>Top Tracks</h3>
    <div id="artistTopTracks"></div>
    <p>Once you click the 'Get Top Tracks' button, you can view the JSON object in the console.</p>

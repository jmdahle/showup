## Project Description


#### Summary
To create a mobile responsive website that will allow a user to search Lollapalooza for artists. The app will have a complete list of performers for the festival. The user will be able to select a performer, see and use links to the performer's external social media, access their "top tracks" through Spotify, and save playlists for that performer to the user's Spotify account. The user is able to log out and when they log back in, their selections are saved in their Spotify account.


#### Project Requirements
*Min of 2 APIs - Ticketmaster api for event, Spotify API for song playlist
*Using Ajax to capture API data
*UI/UX - Developers assigned to focus on Design focusing on look and feel
*Coding Standard -Assigned Developer to maintain code continuity and standards
*Do NOT use alerts, confirms or prompts (use Modals) - Requirement is captured as part of the product design
*Incorporate some repeating element (table columns, etc) - Requirement is captured as part of the product design
*Use Bootstrap or another CSS framework - Requirement is captured as part of the product design
*Deploy to GitHub Pages - Implemented https://github.com/jmdahle/team3project
*Include user input validation - Requirement is captured as part of the product design


## Sketch of the Design
• Modal to prompt the user to login to Spotify for optimal functionality.
• List of all performers at the festival (TicketMaster API) that can be narrowed, searched, and clicked to access performer's details via Spotify (Spotfiy API)
• Tabs of different data objects driven by Spotify API: Artist (image and external social media links); Top Tracks as ranked by Spotify; Playlist (enables user to find existing playlists on Spotify featuring a specific performer--dentified through TicktMaster API--and create custom playlists that are saved to user's own Spotify account if they are logged in.
